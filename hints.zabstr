> "SHUTTLE TRIP" <PLTABLE "Where do I find the shuttle?"
"You need to use the lower elevator to get to it."> <PLTABLE

"You can't operate the shuttle after 6000."
"Hopefully, you can figure out that you want to be in the control cabin facing the set of tracks, not the one facing the blank wall."
> <PLTABLE "How do I use the shuttle controls?"
"First, activate the controls (see previous question)."
"Pushing the lever up into the \"+\" position causes the shuttle to accelerate. Pulling the lever down into the \"-\" position causes the shuttle to decelerate."
"When the lever is in the central position, the shuttle will continue to move at its current velocity."
"The digital display tells the current velocity of the shuttle."> <PLTABLE

"That won't have any effect while the laser is set to 1, of course."
"If you don't keep shooting the microbe, it will get close enough to eat you."
"Repeated shootings of the microbe merely hold it at bay, and sooner or later you're killed when sector 384 comes to life."
"Has the microbe become interested in anything besides you?"
"The microbe is attracted to the warmth of the laser."
"When the laser gets warm enough, throw it over the edge of the strip, into the void below. The microbe will leap after it."
