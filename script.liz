Another routine day of drudgery aboard the Stellar Patrol Ship Feinstein. This
morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the
filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue
self-contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub brush you shine the floor with
a diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First
Class Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.

Deck Nine
This is a featureless corridor similar to every other corridor on the ship. It
curves away to starboard, and a gangway leads up. To port is the entrance to
one of the ship's primary escape pods. The pod bulkhead is closed.

Ensign First Class Blather swaggers in. He studies your work with half-closed
eyes. "You call this polishing, Ensign Seventh Class?" he sneers. "We have a
position for an Ensign Ninth Class in the toilet-scrubbing division, you know.
Thirty demerits." He glares at you, his arms crossed.

A massive explosion rocks the ship. Echoes from the explosion resound
deafeningly down the halls. The door to port slides open. Blather, confused by
this nonroutine occurrence, orders you to continue scrubbing the floor, and
then dashes off.

>W.SAVE
Escape Pod

The ship shakes again. You hear, from close by, the sounds of emergency
bulkheads closing.

To file (PS:<LIZ>START.P): POD.P.1Ok.

>Z.Z
Time passes...

The pod door clangs shut as heavy explosions continue to buffet the Feinstein.

Time passes...

You feel the pod begin to slide down its ejection tube as explosions shake the
mother ship.

>GET IN WEBBING
Escape Pod, in the safety web
You are now safely cushioned within the web.

Through the viewport of the pod you see the Feinstein dwindle as you head
away. Bursts of light dot its hull. Suddenly, a huge explosion blows the
Feinstein into tiny pieces, sending the escape pod tumbling away! 

As the escape pod tumbles away from the former location of the Feinstein, its
gyroscopes whine. The pod slowly stops tumbling. Lights on the control panel
blink furiously as the autopilot searches for a reasonable destination.

>Z.Z
Time passes...

The auxiliary rockets fire briefly, and a nearby planet swings into view
through the port. It appears to be almost entirely ocean, with just a few
visible islands and an unusually small polar ice cap. A moment later, the
system's sun swings into view, and the viewport polarizes into a featureless
black rectangle.

Time passes...

The main thrusters fire a long, gentle burst. A monotonic voice issues from
the control panel. "Approaching planet...human-habitable."

>Z.Z
Time passes...

Time passes...

>Z.Z
Time passes...

Time passes...

The pod is buffeted as it enters the planet's atmosphere.

>Z.Z
Time passes...

You feel the temperature begin to rise, and the pod's climate control system
roars as it labors to compensate.

Time passes...

The viewport suddenly becomes transparent again, giving you a view of endless
ocean below. The lights on the control panel flash madly as the pod's computer
searches for a suitable landing site. The thrusters fire long and hard,
slowing the pod's descent.

>Z.
Time passes...

The pod is now approaching the closer of a pair of islands. It appears to be
surrounded by sheer cliffs rising from the water, and is topped by a wide
plateau. The plateau seems to be covered by a sprawling complex of buildings.

>Z
Time passes...

The pod lands with a thud. Through the viewport you can see a rocky cleft and
some water below. The pod rocks gently back and forth as if it was
precariously balanced. A previously unseen panel slides open, revealing some
emergency provisions, including a survival kit and a towel.

>GET OUT OF WEBBING
Escape Pod
There is a towel here.
There is a survival kit here.
As you stand, the pod shifts slightly and you feel it falling. A moment later,
the fall stops with a shock, and you see water rising past the viewport.

>GET ALL
towel: Taken.
survival kit: Taken.

>OPEN DOOR
The bulkhead opens and cold ocean water rushes in!

The pod is now completely submerged, and you feel it smash against underwater
rocks. Bubbles streaming upward past the window indicate that the pod is
continuing to sink.

>U
Underwater
You are momentarily disoriented as you enter the turbulent waters. Currents
buffet you against the sharp rocks of an underwater cliff. A dim light filters
down from above.

>SAVE
To file (PS:<LIZ>POD.P): UP.P.1Ok.

>U
Crag

>U
Balcony
This is an octagonal room, half carved into and half built out from the cliff
wall. Through the shattered windows which ring the outer wall you can see
ocean to the horizon. A weathered metal plaque with barely readable lettering
rests below the windows. The language seems to be a corrupt form of
Galalingua. A steep stairway, roughly cut into the face of the cliff, leads
upward. A rocky crag can be seen about eight meters below.

>U
Winding Stair
The middle of a long, steep stairway carved into the face of a cliff.

>U
Courtyard
You are in the courtyard of an ancient stone edifice, vaguely reminiscent of
the castles you saw during your leave on Ramos Two. It has decayed to the
point where it can probably be termed a ruin. Openings lead north and west,
and a stairway downward is visible to the south. 

>N
Plain Hall
This is a featureless hall leading north and south. Although the hallway is
old and dusty, the construction is of a much more modern style than the castle
to the south. A similar hall branches off to the northeast.

>NE
Rec Corridor
This is a wide, east-west hallway. Portals lead north and south, and another
corridor branches southwest.

>E
Mess Corridor
This is a wide, east-west hallway with a large portal to the south. A small
door to the north is closed and hooked with a simple steel padlock which is
also closed.

>E
Dorm Corridor
This is a wide, east-west hallway with openings to the north and south. To the
east, the corridor stretches off into the distance. That section of the
hallway is lined with a motorized walkway (no longer running) that was
probably intended to transport people or cargo down that tremendously long
hall.

>E
You walk down the long, featureless hallway for a long time. Finally, you see
an intersection ahead...

Corridor Junction
A north-south corridor intersects the main corridor here. To the west, the
main corridor extends as far as you can see; a nonworking walkway from that
direction ends here. To the east, the corridor widens into a well-lit area.

>I
You are carrying:
  A survival kit
  A towel
  A diary
  A Patrol uniform (being worn)
  The Patrol uniform contains:
    An ID card
  A chronometer (being worn)
  A Patrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose scrub brush

Entrances to rooms lie to the east and west from this north-south hall.

>S.SE.SEARCH ROBOT.TURN IT ON
Mech Corridor South
The corridor ends here with doorways to the southwest, south, and southeast.

Robot Shop
This room, with exits west and northwest, is filled with robot-like devices of
every conceivable description, all in various states of disassembly.
Only one robot, about four feet high, looks even remotely close to being in
working order.

In one of the robot's compartments you find and take a magnetic-striped card
embossed "Loowur Elavaatur Akses Kard."

Nothing happens.

>W.W
Machine Shop
This room is probably some sort of machine shop filled with a variety of
unusual machines. Doorways lead north, east, and west.

Standing against the rear wall is a large dispensing machine with a spout. The
dispenser is lined with brightly colored buttons. The first four buttons,
labelled "KUULINTS 1 - 4", are colored red, blue, green, and yellow. The next
three buttons, labelled "KATALISTS 1 - 3", are colored gray, brown, and black.
The last two buttons are both white. One of these is square and says "BAAS."
The other white button is round and says "ASID."

Tool Room
This is apparently a storage room for tools. Exits lead northeast and east.
A small device, labelled "Akmee Portabul Laazur", is resting on one of the
lower shelves.
The laser contains:
  An old battery
On an upper shelf is a metal bar, curved into a U-shape.
Sitting on the floor below the lowest shelf is a large glass flask.
There is a pair of wide-nosed pliers here.

Admin Corridor South
This section of hallway seems to have suffered some minor structural damage.
The walls are cracked, and a jagged crevice crosses the floor. An opening
leads east and the corridor heads north and south.

>SAVE

>PUT KEY NEAR CRACK
You can't see any key here!

>PUT MAGNET NEAR CRACK
With a spray of dust and a loud clank, a piece of metal leaps from the crevice
and affixes itself to the magnet. It is a steel key! With a tug, you remove
the key from the magnet.

>DROP MAGNET.S.W
Dropped.

Admin Corridor South
There is a curved metal bar here.

>N
Admin Corridor
The hallway, in fact the entire building, has been rent apart here, presumably
by seismic upheaval. You can see the sky through the severed roof above, and
the ground is thick with rubble. To the north is a gaping rift, at least eight
meters across and thirty meters deep. A wide doorway, labelled "Sistumz
Moniturz," leads west.

Floyd rushes into the room and barrels into you. "Oops, sorry," he says.
"Floyd not looking at where he was going to."

>SAVE
Floyd's eyes light up. "Oh boy! Are we gonna try something dangerous now?"

To file (PS:<LIZ>LOCK.P): LADDER.P.1Ok.

>DROP LADDER

>EXTEND LADDER.PUT IT ACROSS RIFT.N
The ladder extends to a length of around eight meters.

The ladder swings out across the rift and comes to rest on the far edge,
spanning the precipice.

You slowly make your way across the swaying ladder. You can see sharp, pointy
rocks at the bottom of the rift, far below...

Admin Corridor North

>W.OPEN DESK THEN GET ALL FROM DRAWER.W.OPEN DRAWER

Large Office
This is a large, plush office. The far wall is one large picture window,
scratched but unbroken, offering a view of this installation and the ocean
beyond. In front of the window is a wide wooden desk. The only exit is east.

Opening the large desk reveals a shuttle access card.

This is a small room with no windows. The sole exit is southwest. Two wide
consoles fill either end of the room; thick cables lead up into the ceiling.

The console on the left side of the room is labelled "Reeseev Staashun." A
bright red light, labelled "Tranzmishun Reeseevd", is blinking rapidly. Next
to the light is a glowing button marked "Mesij Plaabak."

The console on the right side of the room is labelled "Send Staashun." A
screen on the console displays a message. Next to the screen is a flashing
sign which says "Malfunkshun in Sendeeng Kuulint Sistum." Next to this console
is an enunciator. On the console next to the enunciator panel is a
funnel-shaped hole labelled "Kuulint Sistum Manyuuwul Oovuriid."
A yellow colored light is flashing on the enunciator panel.

In their single starcrossed scout ships
Mining ast'roids, spinning lore.

Then one true courageous miner
Spied a spaceship from the stars
Boarded he that alien liner
Out beyond the orb of Mars.

Mighty monsters barred his way
Yet he solved the alien myst'ries
Mining quite a lode that day.

O, they ruled the solar system

You notice the walls of the booth sliding away in all directions, followed by
a momentary queasiness in the pit of your stomach...

Station 384
You are standing on a square plate of heavy metal. Above your head, parallel
to the plate beneath you, is an identical metal plate. To the east is a wide,
metallic strip.

Strip Near Relay
North of here, the filament ends at a huge featureless wall, presumably the
side of some microcomponent. To the east is a vacuu-sealed microrelay, sealed
in transparent red plastic. You could probably see into the microrelay.

>L AT RELAY
This is a vacuum-sealed microrelay, encased in red translucent plastic.
Within, you can see that some sort of speck or impurity has wedged itself into
the contact point of the relay, preventing it from closing. The speck,
presumably of microscopic size, resembles a blue boulder to you in your
current size.

Suddenly, with a loud plop, a giant elephant-sized monster lands on the strip
just in front of you. It is amorphously shaped, its skin a slimy translucent
red membrane. While most of your brain screams with panic about the disgusting
monster that now blocks your exit, some small section in the back of your mind
calmly realizes that this is merely some tiny microbe which has somehow
violated the sterile environment of the computer interior.

As you stand frozen with fear, the microbe slithers toward you, extending
slimy pseudopods thick with waving cilia. It looks pretty hungry, and seems
intent on having you for lunch.

Cryo-Anteroom
The elevator closes as you leave it, and you find yourself in a small, chilly
room. To the north, through a wide arch, is an enormous chamber lined from
floor to ceiling with thousands of cryo-units. You can see similar chambers
beyond, and your mind staggers at the thought of the millions of individuals
asleep for countless centuries.

In the anteroom where you stand is a solitary cryo-unit, its cover frosted.
Next to the cryo-unit is a complicated control panel.

A door slides open and a medical robot glides in. It opens the cryo-unit and
administers an injection to its inhabitant. As the robot glides away, a figure
rises from the cryo-unit -- a handsome, middle-aged woman with flowing red
hair. She spends some time studying readouts from the control panel, pressing
several keys.

As other cryo-units in the chambers beyond begin opening, the woman turns to
you, bows gracefully, and speaks in a beautiful, lilting voice. "I am Veldina,
leader of Resida. Thanks to you, the cure has been discovered, and the
planetary systems repaired. We are eternally grateful."

"You will also be glad to hear that a ship of your Stellar Patrol now orbits
the planet. I have sent them the coordinates for this room." As if on cue, a
landing party from the S.P.S. Flathead materializes nearby. Blather is with
them, having been picked up from deep space in another escape pod, babbling
cravenly. Captain Sterling of the Flathead acknowledges your heroic actions,
and informs you of your promotion to Lieutenant First Class.

As a team of mutant hunters head for the cryo-elevator, Veldina mentions that
the grateful people of Resida offer you leadership of their world. Captain
Sterling points out that, even if you choose to remain on Resida, Blather
(demoted to Ensign Twelfth Class) has been assigned as your personal toilet
attendant.

You feel a sting from your arm and turn to see a medical robot moving away
after administering the antidote for The Disease.

A team of robot technicians step into the anteroom. They part their ranks, and
a familiar figure comes bounding toward you! "Hi!" shouts Floyd, with
uncontrolled enthusiasm. "Floyd feeling better now!" Smiling from ear to ear,
he says, "Look what Floyd found!" He hands you a helicopter key, a reactor
elevator card, and a paddleball set. "Maybe we can use them in the sequel..."
